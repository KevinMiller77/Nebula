# Summary #
This project actually consists of 2 seperate projects where one builds off of the other. 
At the core, we have the Nebula engine. This is a C++ powered engine using the OpenGL backend and that can be easily incorporated into any project

My aim when beginning this was simply to learn everything I could about rendering, 3D objects, and runtime scripting.
I wanted an engine completely made by me so thta I could customize everything I needed when developing games instead of
adopting style and etiquitte set by Unreal or Unity.

If you need to quickly get yourself a rendering loop and get some 2D/3D objects drawn with scripting, this is for you.
