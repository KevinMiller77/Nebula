# Summary #
This project actually consists of 2 seperate projects where one builds off of the other. 
At the core, we have the Nebula engine. This is a C++ powered engine using the OpenGL backend and that can be easily incorporated into any project
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======

My aim when beginning this was simply to learn everything I could about rendering, 3D objects, and runtime scripting.
I wanted an engine completely made by me so thta I could customize everything I needed when developing games instead of
adopting style and etiquitte set by Unreal or Unity.

If you need to quickly get yourself a rendering loop and get some 2D/3D objects drawn with scripting, this is for you.

# Current Features #
- Works on Windows and Linux
- Build system for both WIndows and Linux
- Virtual Filesystem for easy asset access
- API independant rendering
- OpenGL backend
- Custom Math library
- Dear ImGui integration for UI
- Full debugging system and tracer
- Custom event system
- Texturing
- Framebuffers
- GLSL shaders
- C++ scripting
# Planned Features #
- MacOS (Would work if they didn't ditch OpenGL right before it got fancy)
- Multithreading
- Easier importing of obj or fbx files
- Particles
- Text
- Sound
- Custom UI library
- Animation Engine
